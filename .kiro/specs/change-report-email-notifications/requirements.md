# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a PowerShell script that automatically sends daily email notifications containing change reports from a SQL database. The script will filter for changes with Critical and High priority levels and include specific change details in the email notification to keep stakeholders informed of important changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to receive daily email notifications for critical and high priority changes, so that I can stay informed about important system modifications that require attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script executes THEN the system SHALL query the SQL database for change records with Priority values of "Critical" or "High"
2. WHEN change records are found THEN the system SHALL include the following fields in the email: ChangeID, Priority, Type, Configuration Item, ShortDescription, AssignmentsGroup, AssignedTo, ActualStartDate, ActualEndDate
3. WHEN no critical or high priority changes are found THEN the system SHALL send an email indicating no critical changes for the day
4. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL send the email notification to configured recipients

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a change manager, I want the email notifications to be formatted clearly and contain all relevant change information, so that I can quickly assess the impact and status of critical changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the email THEN the system SHALL format the change data in a readable table or structured format
2. WHEN multiple changes exist THEN the system SHALL group them by priority level (Critical first, then High)
3. WHEN displaying dates THEN the system SHALL format ActualStartDate and ActualEndDate in a consistent, readable format
4. WHEN the email is sent THEN the system SHALL include a clear subject line indicating it's a daily change report with the current date

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the script to securely connect to the SQL database using proper authentication, so that database access is controlled and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to the database THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication methods (Windows Authentication or SQL Server Authentication)
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and send a notification email about the failure
3. WHEN executing SQL queries THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
4. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL properly close database connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the script to be configurable and schedulable, so that I can customize email settings and automate daily execution without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the script THEN the system SHALL allow specification of database connection parameters (server, database name, authentication method)
2. WHEN configuring email settings THEN the system SHALL allow specification of SMTP server, sender email, recipient list, and authentication credentials
3. WHEN scheduling the script THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Windows Task Scheduler for daily execution
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
5. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL validate all configuration parameters before proceeding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a recipient of change notifications, I want the email to include summary information and be sent at a consistent time daily, so that I can plan my day and prioritize my work accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending the email THEN the system SHALL include a summary count of Critical and High priority changes
2. WHEN the script is scheduled THEN the system SHALL execute at the same time each day (configurable)
3. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include the date range covered by the report
4. WHEN no changes are found THEN the system SHALL still send a confirmation email stating "No critical or high priority changes for [date]"
